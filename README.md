# ATMega328 or ATMega328P Tutorial
Hello! In this tutorial, I will be teaching you how to construct a fully functioning ATMega328 from scratch.
There will be **2** methods of this and I will be showing you both ways.
One way is by constructing a circuit on breadboard and the other is by soldering components on to a protoboard.
Either methods will generate same or similar result so choose whichever one you prefer.

## Pre-Prerequisites
Before you begin, you should have some knowledge of [how to use a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all) or [soldering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqV2xU1fee8) and reading schematics.

This will be an in-depth guide so *theoretically* you don't need to know all these but I want this to be a tutorial where you could learn why and how things work instead of just running around with a finished microcontroller not knowing how different components inside actually works.

## Prerequisites / Materials
You need these items in order to proceed with the construction process!
There is going to be Amazon links to these materials.

- [ ] 1 x [Breadboard](https://a.co/d/gcQUHnz)
- [ ] 2 x [0.1 µF 50V Ceramic Capacitor]()
- [ ] 1 x [0.1 µF Ceramic Capacitor]()
- [ ] 1 x 16MHz Quartz Crystal Clock
- [ ] 1 x AVR ICSP Programming Adaptor
- [ ] 1 x ATMega328 or ATMega328
- [ ] 1 x Any color 5mm LED
- [ ] 2 x 330Ω Resistors
- [ ] 1 x ATMega2560
- [ ] 1 x USB-A to USB-B Cable
- [ ] 1 x PC or Mac that has [Arduino IDE](https://support.arduino.cc/hc/en-us/articles/360019833020-Download-and-install-Arduino-IDE)

If you are going the second route of *soldering* then get everything mentioned above **except** the breadboard and instead buy these...

- [ ] 1 x Protoboard
- [ ] 1 x [Soldering Kit](https://www.amazon.com/Soldering-Interchangeable-Adjustable-Temperature-Enthusiast/dp/B087767KNW/ref=sr_1_6?keywords=soldering%2Bkit&qid=1687306680&sr=8-6&th=1) *This has all you need!*
