# Making-ATMega328
Hello! In this tutorial, I will be teaching you how to construct a fully functioning ATMega328 from scratch.
There will be **2** methods of this and I will be showing you both ways.
One way is by constructing a circuit on breadboard and the other is by soldering components on to a protoboard.

## Pre-Prerequisites
Before you begin, you should have some knowledge of [how to use a breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all) or [soldering](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqV2xU1fee8).

## Prerequisites for constructing on breadboard
You need these items in order to proceed with the construction process!
There is going to be Amazon links to these materials

- [ ] 1 x [Breadboard](https://a.co/d/gcQUHnz)
- [ ] 2 x [0.1 µF 50V Ceramic Capacitor]
- [ ] 1 x [0.1 µF Ceramic Capacitor
